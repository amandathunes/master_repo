Data recorded at University of Oslo for the Teflon project
Document started on 2022-10-13 and maintained by <giampiero.salvi@ntnu.no>

The data is organized in the following directories:
- speech: wave files with recordings of isolated words. Sampled at 44.1kHz.
- speech16khz: same files as in speech/ but downsampled to 16kHz with the commands:
  cd speech
  find -name "*.wav" -exec sox {} ../speech16khz/{} rate 16000 \;
- assessments: pronunciation assessment stored in one excel file for each word.
         The assessments contain a global 5 level scale, a score for each phoneme,
	 and a number of extra columns on different kinds of noises.
- assessments.csv: the information from the excel files has been collected into a
         single csv file with the help of the scripts at
	 https://github.com/giampierosalvi/TeflonNorwegianDataset
	 The csv file contains a row for each wave file and each assessment. The
	 description of each column can be found at the github repository.

The audio file names contain information about the speaker id and the spoken word:

<speaker_id>_<word>.wav

The speaker_id contains a letter and two digits, the letters indicate:
a: non-native speaker of Norwegian
d, p: native speaker of Norwegian
The digits are incremental for each speaker.
