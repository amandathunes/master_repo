The folder «Word Assesments - Excel files» contains 
	this file
	one file «who_did_what»
	an .xslx file for each of the different words that have been assesses.


The file «who_did_what» describes which assessor/person assessed which word like this:
	- Column 1 «Both»: Words were assessed by both assessors, individually
	- Column 2 «Together»: Words were assessed by both assessors, together
	- Column 3 «Anne Marte»: Words were assessed by only assessor Anne Marte
	- Column 4 «Jeanett»: Words were assessed by assessor Jeanett

The excel-files for the different words contain two sheets when the word has been assessed by both. Sheet 1 named "Anne Marte" assessed 
by Anne Marte, and Sheet 2 named "Jeanett" assessed by Jeanett.
The files for the different words contain only one sheet when the word has been assessed by only one assessor.


The excel-files for the different words contains these columns:
	1 «File name»: The name of the .wav file on the form «ParticipantCode_Word.wav»
	2 «Score»: The score (0 - 5) given the speech sample in that .wav file (see scoring criteria below)
	3-n: Phonetic transcription (SAMPA). One column per phone. 1 = Correct, 0 = Mispronunciation, - = sound is "legally" missing (the sound is optional in Norwegian).
	n+1 «Prosody»: If 1 there is something wrong with the prosody (here defined as intonation/tone/stress/rythm) in that speech sample. If blank there is no mistake in prosody.
	n+2 «Noise/Disruption»: If 1 there is noise in the recoding. Including both background noise and noise/clipping from equipment error etc. If blank there is no noise/disruption.
	n+3 «Pre-speech noise»:  If 1 you can hear the model speaker at the beginning of the clip before the child starts talking. If blank there is no model speaker in the beginning.
	n+4 «Repetition: If 1 the child attempts more than once at saying the word. It is the final attempt that have been assessed. If blank the word is only said once.


For most words there are 52 participants saying the words. Participant codes starting with «a» have no or short exposure to Norwegian, and 
participant codes starting with «d» are native Norwegian speakers.
Some of the words have 20 participants saying the word.


The scores are given from these criteria:
	1: Attempt with no resemblance to target word/interrupted speech (with 2+ sounds missing)/ impossible to locate specific segmental errors.
	2: Mumbled attempt/ two or more major mispronunciations (phonetic/prosodic).
	3: One major mispronunciation/ two minor mispronunciations (phonetic/prosodic). E.g. one phone that is wrong, i.e., 
		becomes a different Norwegian phoneme/two sounds that are "off"/ suprasegmental error/tone error + mispronunciation of phone.
	4: Only minor mispronunciation (phonetic/prosodic). E.g. one sound that is "off", but not so much that it becomes a 
		different Norwegian phone and/or (minor) suprasegmental error (even if that makes it another word (bønder/bønner)).
	5: Native/native-like. No mistakes
